# BioInformatics course project

Implementation of the course project bioinformatics. Here different machine learning approaches are implemented for the prediction of active and inactive 
cis-regulatory regions in the HepG2 cell line from the Human Genome (HG38) with different setup.
All the details are descreibed in the [report](https://github.com/albertorumi/BioInformaticsUnimi/blob/main/ProjectReport.pdf) and the 
[implementation notebook]. (https://github.com/albertorumi/BioInformaticsUnimi/blob/main/Project_implementation.ipynb)
